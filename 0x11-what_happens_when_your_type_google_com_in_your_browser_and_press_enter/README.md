Have you ever wondered what happens when you type “google.com” in your web browser and press enter? We all use the internet every day, and accessing websites is a routine task, but have you ever thought about what is happening behind the scenes?

In this topic, we’ll explore the process of accessing a website and take a closer look at what happens when you type “google.com” in your browser. We’ll cover everything from domain name resolution to establishing a connection with the server hosting the website and downloading the web page’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. By the end of this discussion, you’ll have a better understanding of the complex process that happens each time you access a website on the internet.

When you type “google.com” in your web browser and press enter, a complex series of steps are triggered to display the website on your screen.

Let’s take a closer look at each of these steps to better understand the process of accessing a website.

When you type “google.com” in your web browser and press enter, a complex series of steps are triggered to display the website on your screen. Let’s take a closer look at each of these steps to better understand the process of accessing a website.

1. Domain Name Resolution
The first step in accessing a website is resolving the domain name to an IP address. The domain name is the human-readable name that we use to access a website, such as “google.com”. However, computers on the internet communicate with each other using IP addresses, which are numerical addresses, such as 172.217.164.68. To resolve the domain name to an IP address, your computer sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server. The DNS server looks up the IP address associated with the domain name and sends it back to your computer.

2. Establishing a Connection with the Server
Once your computer has the IP address of the server hosting the website, it needs to establish a connection with that server. This is done using a protocol called the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP ensures that packets of data are reliably transmitted between your computer and the server. Your computer sends a request to the server to establish a TCP connection, and the server responds with an acknowledgment to confirm the connection has been established.

3. Sending an HTTP Request
Once the TCP connection is established, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol used to transfer data between web browsers and web servers. The request includes the web page that you are trying to access, such as “/index.html”, as well as any other information that the server needs to process the request.

4. Processing the Request
The server receives the HTTP request and begins processing it. This involves retrieving the web page that you are trying to access and any other resources required to display the page, such as images or stylesheets. The server may also perform any necessary calculations or database queries to generate the web page dynamically.

5. Sending an HTTP Response
Once the server has processed the request, it sends an HTTP response back to your web browser. The response includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code required to display the web page on your screen. The response also includes any other resources, such as images or stylesheets, that were requested in the original HTTP request.

6. Rendering the Web Page
Once your web browser has received the HTTP response from the server, it begins rendering the web page. This involves parsing the HTML code to create a Document Object Model (DOM), applying the CSS stylesheets to the DOM to create a Render Object Model (ROM), and executing any JavaScript code to add interactivity or dynamic content to the page. The web page is then displayed on your screen.

In conclusion, accessing a website involves a complex series of steps, from domain name resolution to rendering the web page on your screen. Each of these steps must be performed quickly and reliably to ensure a seamless user experience. Next time you type “google.com” in your web browser and press enter, you can appreciate the complex process that makes it all possible.
